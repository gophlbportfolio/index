  Some of my work:
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="https://gophlbportfolio.github.io/rickmortyhangman/" target=_blank>Rick and Morty hangman (beta version, November 2019)</a>: 
      <br/>
      The classic hangman with a little spice up :)
      <br/>
      Fight the <a href="https://rickandmorty.fandom.com/wiki/Cromulons" target=_blank>Cromulons</a> and the clock.
      <br/>
      Try to guess the name of the character but be careful: every mistake will make disappear some of your seconds!

      <a href="https://gophlbportfolio.github.io/tileWar/" target=_blank>The tile war (alfa version, October 2019)</a>:
      <br/>
      A board game for two (or a very bored one) in which you will have to defeat your enemy.
      <br/> 
      Everytime you refresh the page you will get a random grid with random placement of chips and non playable tiles.
      <br/> 
      You decide your strategy: merge your chips, destroy the enemy and absorb its energy if your chip is stronger, 
      or be a kamikaze and sacrifice your chip just to weaken the enemy.
      <br/><br/>
      <i>Known issues:</i>
      <br/> 
      <ul>
        <li>Sometimes free tiles are not recognized as free, so the movement is not allowed.</li>
        <li>Sometimes the merge (or attack) doesn't happen and the chip just rest above the other.</li>
      </ul>
